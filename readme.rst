Taskwarrior Capsules -- The easy plugin framework for Taskwarrior
=================================================================

Taskwarrior Capsules allows you to easily extend Taskwarrior functionality
to add new commands and other things.


Installation
------------

1. Install from Pip::

    pip install taskwarrior-capsules

2. That's all!


Use
---

Rather than using ``task``, use ``tw`` as the command you use to interact
with taskwarrior.  Although you're using a different command than before,
commands that do not invoke one of your installed plugins will be passed
verbatim to Taskwarrior just as if you were using ``task`` all along.
